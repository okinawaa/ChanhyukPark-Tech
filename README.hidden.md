I want to stay by the sea<br/>
Watching turn into red<br/>
Sat down with the people<br/>
Moon is slowly rising<br/>
I see the trees are moving<br/>
Sky is brightened through the moon<br/>

Look at those trees<br/>
Look how they move by the breeze<br/>
Look at those stars<br/>
Look how they shine through the night<br/>
